# Heart_disease_prediction
Notebook file

Here we are doing data wrangling and training and testing the dataset.

Finally we are going to find whether the person has heart disease or not based on some input.

Then we are predicting the values and the accuracy score for both training and testing things.

We are using Logistic Regression in this problem statement to find whether the person has heart disease or not.
